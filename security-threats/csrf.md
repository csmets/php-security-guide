### Sea-surf Attack (CSRF)

This attack forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which he/she is currently authenticated. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data and operation in case of normal user. If the targeted end user is the administrator account, this can compromise the entire web application.
